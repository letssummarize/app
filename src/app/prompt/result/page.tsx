The current TypeScript compiler, which is written in TypeScript itself, has limitations in low-level optimizations. To address this, Microsoft has chosen to rewrite the compiler in Go, a language developed by Google, known for its simplicity and efficiency. This change is expected to significantly improve performance, reducing compile times from 70 seconds to just 7 seconds in some cases.' />

The rewrite is not just a complete overhaul but a porting process that aims to preserve the original behavior and semantics of TypeScript. Although the new compiler won't be available until TypeScript 7, the move is seen as a strategic choice by Microsoft to prioritize performance and portability over using in-house languages or jumping on current trends." />
